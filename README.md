My main goal for the application is for it to display the current time for various international tourist cities and include interactive features, adhering to (HCI) principles.

Structured Design Process
User Research

Objective: Understand the needs and preferences of potential users who require an international clock app.
Method: Conduct interviews with travelers, business professionals, and international event coordinators.
Findings: Users need an easy-to-use interface that quickly displays accurate times for multiple cities, offers customization options, and provides additional features like maps and charts.
Prototyping

Objective: Create low-fidelity wireframes to visualize the app's layout and functionality.
Method: Use tools like Figma or Balsamiq to design wireframes.
Wireframes: Design layouts for a multi-column interface displaying times, maps, and interactive charts.
Usability Testing

Objective: Test the prototype with real users to identify usability issues.
Method: Conduct usability tests with a sample group of users and gather feedback.
Iterations: Modify the design based on feedback, focusing on improving navigation, data visibility, and overall user satisfaction.
Accessibility

Objective: Ensure the app is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
Guidelines: Follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
Implementation: Use appropriate color contrasts, provide alt text for images, and ensure keyboard navigability.
Reflection

Objective: Reflect on the design process, user feedback, and iterations.
Content: Document the challenges faced, solutions implemented, and overall user feedback.
